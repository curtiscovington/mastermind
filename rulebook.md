# The Mastermind: Tabletop Rulebook

## Theme Overview
The Mastermind casts players as elite operatives in a covert agency trying to expose a hidden Mastermind steering a global syndicate. Two factions compete: the Agency is racing to secure and enact protective protocols, while the Syndicate pushes destabilizing directives to tighten the Mastermind’s grip. Bluffing, deduction, and coordinated leadership are key to survival.

## Roles & Factions
- **Agency Operatives (Loyalists):** Majority team. Win by enacting Agency policies or eliminating the Mastermind. Know only their own identity.
- **Syndicate Agents:** Minority team. Know each other (except the Mastermind) and win by enacting Syndicate policies or securing the Mastermind’s ascent.
- **The Mastermind:** Hidden Syndicate leader. Does not reveal to Agency. Knows who the Syndicate Agents are (in higher player counts you may optionally keep the Mastermind blind for added difficulty). The Mastermind must survive; their late-game appointment to leadership can clinch the Syndicate win.

Suggested player-count role mixes:
- 5 players: 3 Agency, 1 Syndicate Agent, 1 Mastermind.
- 6 players: 4 Agency, 1 Syndicate Agent, 1 Mastermind.
- 7 players: 4 Agency, 2 Syndicate Agents, 1 Mastermind.
- 8 players: 5 Agency, 2 Syndicate Agents, 1 Mastermind.
- 9–10 players: 6 Agency, 2–3 Syndicate Agents, 1 Mastermind.

## Setup
1. Shuffle role cards per count above; deal one face-down to each player. Players secretly view their role.
2. Create a policy deck with **11 Syndicate** and **6 Agency** policy cards; shuffle and place face-down. Discard pile starts empty.
3. Seat players in a circle. Randomly select the first **Director** (leadership role) and hand them the Director placard.
4. Place Agency and Syndicate policy tracks (6 slots each) within view, plus markers for any special power thresholds.

## Round Structure
Each round proceeds through these phases:

### 1) Leadership Nomination
- The current **Director** nominates a **Global Operative** who is not the previous Director. The Director and Global Operative form the **Council** for the round.
- Pass the Director placard clockwise each round unless a special power overrides it.

### 2) Voting
- All players simultaneously vote **Approve** or **Reject** the proposed Council.
- If majority approves (ties fail), the Council stands and play advances. If rejected, advance the Director placard to the next player and increase the **Instability marker** by one; after three consecutive rejections, top-deck and enact the next policy automatically, then reset Instability and continue with the next Director.

### 3) Policy Enactment
- The Director draws the top three policy cards. Without revealing them, they discard one face-down to the discard pile and pass two to the Global Operative.
- The Global Operative secretly discards one and enacts the remaining policy face-up to the appropriate track.
- If the policy deck has fewer than three cards, shuffle the discard pile to form a new deck before drawing.

### 4) Special Powers
Certain Syndicate policy thresholds grant the Director one of these powers immediately after enactment (before the next round starts):
- **Investigation (after 1 or 2 Syndicate policies depending on player count):** Peek at a target player’s role card and privately announce “Agency” or “Syndicate-aligned”.
- **Surveillance (mid-game):** View the top three policy cards, reorder them, and return them to the deck.
- **Special Election (late-game):** Choose the next Director instead of passing left; normal order resumes afterward.
- **Purge (execution, late-game):** Eliminate a player from the game; they cannot speak or vote. If the Mastermind is executed, the Agency wins instantly.

## Win Conditions
- **Agency Victory:** Enact five Agency policies **or** execute the Mastermind.
- **Syndicate Victory:** Enact six Syndicate policies **or** elect the Mastermind as Global Operative after three (or more) Syndicate policies are already on the board.

## Player Counts & Timing
- Recommended range: **5–10 players**. Lower counts play faster and have fewer investigative powers; higher counts add more Syndicate Agents and more special powers.
- Expect 45–90 minutes depending on player familiarity and table talk.

## Quick Reference Flow
1. Director nominates Global Operative.
2. Table votes to approve Council.
3. If approved: Director draws 3, discards 1; Global Operative discards 1, enacts 1.
4. Resolve special power if unlocked.
5. Check win conditions; otherwise pass (or assign) Director and repeat.
